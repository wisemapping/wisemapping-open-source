        1.1 Baraloto et al. 2010. Functional trait variation and sampling strategies in species-rich plant communities

                            Therecent growth of large functional trait data
                            bases has been fuelled by standardized protocols forthe
                            measurement of individual functional traits and intensive
                            efforts to compile trait data(Cornelissen etal. 2003; Chave etal. 2009). Nonetheless, there remains no consensusfor
                            the most appropriate sampling design so that traits can be
                            scaled from the individuals on whom measurements are
                            made to the community or ecosystem levels at which infer-
                            ences are drawn (Swenson etal. 2006,2007,Reich,Wright
                            & Lusk 2007;Kraft,Valencia & Ackerly 2008).

                            However, the fast pace of
                            development of plant trait meta-analyses also suggests that
                            trait acquisition in the field is a factor limiting the growth of
                            plant trait data bases.

                            We measured
                            traits for every individual tree in nine 1-ha plots in tropical
                            lowland rainforest (N = 4709). Each plant was sampled for
                            10 functional traits related to wood and leaf morphology and
                            ecophysiology. Here, we contrast the trait means and variances
                            obtained with a full sampling strategy with those of
                            other sampling designs used in the recent literature, which we
                            obtain by simulation. We assess the differences in community-
                            level estimates of functional trait means and variances
                            among design types and sampling intensities. We then contrast
                            the relative costs of these designs and discuss the appropriateness
                            of different sampling designs and intensities for
                            different questions and systems.

                            With regard to estimating mean trait values, strategies
                            alternative to BRIDGE were consistently cost-effective. On
                            the other hand, strategies alternative to BRIDGE clearly
                            failed to accurately estimate the variance of trait values. This
                            indicates that in situations where accurate estimation of plotlevel
                            variance is desired, complete censuses are essential.

                            We suggest that, in these studies,
                            the investment in complete sampling may be worthwhile
                            for at least some traits.

                            Here, we develop a new approach that links functional attributes
                            of tree species with studies of forest recovery and regional
                            land-use transitions (Chazdon et al. 2007). Grouping species according
                            to their functional attributes or demographic rates provides
                            insight into both applied and theoretical questions, such as selecting
                            species for reforestation programs, assessing ecosystem services, and
                            understanding community assembly processes in tropical forests
                            (Diaz et al. 2007, Kraft et al. 2008).

                            Since we have data on leaf
                            and wood functional traits for only a subset of the species in our
                            study sites, we based our functional type classification on information
                            for a large number of tree species obtained through vegetation
                            monitoring studies.
                        
                    
                
            
            1.2.3 Falar no artigo que esse trabalho fala que é inadequada a divisão entre pioneira e não pioneira devido a grande variação que há entre elas. Além de terem descoberto que durante a ontogenia a resposta a luminosidade muda dentro de uma mesma espécie. Porém recomendar que essa classificação continue sendo usada em curto prazo enquanto não há informações confiáveis suficiente para esta simples classificação. Outras classificações como esta do artigo são bem vinda, contanto que tenham dados confiáveis. Porém dados estáticos já são difíceis de se obter, dados temporais, como taxa de crescimento em diâmetro ou altura, são mais difíceis ainda. Falar que vários tipos de classificações podem ser utilizadas e quanto mais detalhe melhor, porém os dados é que são mais limitantes. Se focarmos em dados de germinação e crescimento limitantes, como sugerem sainete e whitmore, da uma idéia maismrápida e a curto prazo da classificação destas espécies. Depois com o tempo conseguiremos construir classificações mais detalhadas e com mais dados confiáveis.

                            Our approach avoided preconceived notions of successional
                            behavior or shade tolerance of tree species by developing an objective
                            and independent classification of functional types based on vegetation
                            monitoring data from permanent sample plots in mature and
                            secondary forests of northeastern Costa Rica (Finegan et al. 1999,
                            Chazdon et al. 2007).We apply an independent, prior classification
                            of 293 tree species from our study region into five functional types, based on two species attributes: canopy strata and diameter growth
                            rates for individuals Z10 cm dbh (Finegan et al. 1999, Salgado-
                            Negret 2007).

                            Our results demonstrate strong linkages between functional
                            types defined by adult height and growth rates of large trees and
                            colonization groups based on the timing of seedling, sapling, and
                            tree recruitment in secondary forests.

                            These results allow us to move beyond earlier conceptual
                            frameworks of tropical forest secondary succession developed
                            by Finegan (1996) and Chazdon (2008) based on subjective groupings,
                            such as pioneers and shade-tolerant species (Swaine &
                            Whitmore 1988).
                        
                    
                
            
            1.2.7 
                
                    
                        
                        
                            Reproductive traits, such as dispersal mode, pollination mode,
                            and sexual system, were ultimately not useful in delimiting tree
                            functional types for the tree species examined here (Salgado-Negret
                            2007). Thus, although reproductive traits do vary quantitatively in
                            abundance between secondary and mature forests in our landscape
                            (Chazdon et al. 2003), they do not seem to be important drivers of
                            successional dynamics of trees Z10 cm dbh. For seedlings, however,
                            dispersal mode and seed size are likely to play an important
                            role in community dynamics during succession (Dalling&Hubbell
                            2002).

                            Our classification of colonization groups defies the traditional
                            dichotomy between ‘late successional’ shade-tolerant and ‘early successional’
                            pioneer species. Many tree species, classified here as
                            regenerating pioneers on the basis of their population structure in
                            secondary forests, are common in both young secondary forest and
                            mature forests in this region (Guariguata et al. 1997), and many are
                            important timber species (Vilchez et al. 2008). These generalists are
                            by far the most abundant species of seedlings and saplings, conferring
                            a high degree of resilience in the wet tropical forests of NE
                            Costa Rica (Norden et al. 2009, Letcher & Chazdon 2009). The
                            high abundance of regenerating pioneers in seedling and sapling
                            size classes clearly shows that species with shade-tolerant seedlings
                            can also recruit as trees early in succession. For these species, early
                            tree colonization enhances seedling and sapling recruitment during
                            the first 20–30 yr of succession, due to local seed rain. Species
                            abundance and size distribution depend strongly on chance colonization
                            events early in succession (Chazdon 2008). Other studies
                            have shown that mature forest species are able to colonize early in
                            succession (Finegan 1996, van Breugel et al. 2007, Franklin & Rey
                            2007, Ochoa-Gaona et al. 2007), emphasizing the importance of
                            initial floristic composition in the determination of successional
                            pathways and rates of forest regrowth. On the other hand, significant
                            numbers of species in our sites (40% overall and the majority
                            of rare species) colonized only after canopy closure, and these species
                            may not occur as mature individuals until decades after agricultural
                            abandonment.

                            based on functional traits with low plasticity, such as wood density
                            and seed size, could potentially serve as robust proxies for demographic
                            variables (Poorter et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2008).

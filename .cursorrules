# WiseMapping Backend Coding Guidelines

## 1. Copyright Headers

**MANDATORY**: All source code files MUST include the WiseMapping copyright header.

1. **Required Header**:
   - Every `.java` and other source code files MUST start with the copyright header
   - The header MUST be placed at the very beginning of the file, before the package declaration or any imports
   - Use the following format exactly:
     ```java
     /*
      *    Copyright [2007-2025] [wisemapping]
      *
      *   Licensed under WiseMapping Public License, Version 1.0 (the "License").
      *   It is basically the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License") plus the
      *   "powered by wisemapping" text requirement on every single page;
      *   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
      *   You may obtain a copy of the license at
      *
      *       https://github.com/wisemapping/wisemapping-open-source/blob/main/LICENSE.md
      *
      *   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
      *   distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      *   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
      *   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
      *   limitations under the License.
      */
     ```

2. **When Creating New Files**:
   - ALWAYS add the copyright header as the first thing when creating any new source file
   - The header should come before the `package` statement in Java files
   - Never create a file without the copyright header

3. **When Editing Existing Files**:
   - If a file is missing the copyright header, add it at the top of the file
   - Maintain the existing header format if it's already present

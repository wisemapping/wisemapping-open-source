With a background in massage therapy, acupuncture, ayurvedic healing \nand yoga, the trio were well equipped to merge their skills and create adventures \nunique to the travel and wellbeing industries.\nOver a decade on, Michelle King has taken the reigns and shaped the offering, \nensuring yoga is the beating heart of each adventure, complemented by healthy \nfood, experiential travel and the nurturing sense of community within a group of \nlike minded people.\n]]></text></topic></topic></map>",

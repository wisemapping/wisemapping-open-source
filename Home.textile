h1. What is WiseMapping Open Source?

WiseMapping is a free web based mindmapping application. The goal of this project is to provide a high quality product that can be deployed by educational  and academic institutions, private and public companies and anyone who needs to have a mindmapping application. WiseMapping is based on the same code source supporting WiseMapping.com. 

h1. Why Open Source ?

In the last years, we have received hundred of mails from different persons asking for:
Integrating wisemapping.com with their sites
Deploying a private instance of wisemapping.com
Participating in the development of the site
All this make us wonder "Why if we share our product to all this people and invite them to participate with us in this journey ?" .

h1. Who are we ?

We’re a couple of friends working on an idea: “Create the best on-line collaborative mind mapping tool ever created”. This has been our idea since the first day we started.
